# Industrialisation-des-environnements-web-valentin

### READ CAREFULLY
I strongly recommend to use <strong><u>ssh</u></strong> to work on this repository. <br>
You can also work with https.

In order to clone the project, use : <br>
`git clone git@github.com:ValentinLENFANT/industrialisation-des-environnements-web-valentin.git`
<br> OR <br>
`git clone https://github.com/ValentinLENFANT/industrialisation-des-environnements-web-valentin.git`
<br>
<br>
Try to do some modifications and push it :
<br>
* On your own branch with : `git push origin branchName`
* On the develop branch with : `git push origin develop`
<br>
<strong> You will not be able to directly push on master branch. You will have to do a pull request.</strong>
<br><br>
Below a list of the 3 main features :
# 1)
The first main functionnality of this application is : <br>
<ul> To hash the string you want with the complexity* you want </ul>

## 2)
The second functionnality, similar to the first one, is :
<ul> To see the impact of the complexity of the energy consumtion</ul>

### 3)

Finally the third functionnality is for fun, I let you discover it!
